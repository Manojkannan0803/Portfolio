Route_Planner:
ðŸš€ A* Path Planning Implementation in Python
This project implements the A search algorithm* for pathfinding using a modular approach. The PathPlanner class dynamically integrates various helper functions from PathPlanner_functions.py, making it flexible and easily extendable.

ðŸ›  Features
A Search Algorithm*: Efficient pathfinding from a start node to a goal node.
Modular Design: Functions are dynamically attached to PathPlanner for flexibility.
Predefined Maps: Supports map_10 and map_40 datasets.
Visualization: Option to visualize maps and computed paths.
Automated Testing: Includes test.py for validating correctness.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
ðŸ“¦ Project Root
â”œâ”€â”€ helpers.py               # Helper functions for loading and visualizing maps
â”œâ”€â”€ PathPlanner.py           # Main PathPlanner class for A* pathfinding
â”œâ”€â”€ PathPlanner_functions.py # Collection of functions dynamically added to PathPlanner
â”œâ”€â”€ test.py                  # Test suite for validating pathfinding logic
â””â”€â”€ main.py                  # Entry point to run the A* algorithm

ðŸš€ Quick Start
1. Clone the repository:
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/a-star-path-planner.git
     cd a-star-path-planner
2. Install dependencies (if any).
3. Run the main script to test the path planner: python main.py
4. (Optional) Visualize the generated path by uncommenting the show_map calls.

ðŸ§ª Running Tests
To verify the implementation, run: python test.py

Running the planner on map_40 with start node 5 and goal node 34 should produce: great! Your code works for these inputs!
